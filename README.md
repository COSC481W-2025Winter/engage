<p><b> Johnny Zheng </b><br>
Hello, I am a computer science major in my senior year at Eastern Michigan University. I am a reserved person who values growth and improvement. Although I value my alone time, I do like interacting and collaborating with others. Even though I don't consider myself as a leader, I am not afraid to take command if that becomes necessary. Some of my standout traits are my persistence and my ability to learn quickly. Moreover, I am constantly working at developing my interests and becoming better at the things that I am good at whether that would be coding, art, cooking, or chess. It is not hard for me to lose myself for hours perfecting a skill. </p>
