            bio="Hello, I am a computer science major in my senior year at Eastern Michigan University. I am a reserved person who values growth and improvement. Although I value my alone time, I do like interacting and collaborating with others. Even though I don't consider myself as a leader, I am not afraid to take command if that becomes necessary. Some of my standout traits are my persistence and my ability to learn quickly. Moreover, I am constantly working at developing my interests and becoming better at the things that I am good at whether that would be coding, art, cooking, or chess. It is not hard for me to lose myself for hours perfecting a skill."

            bio="Hi! I’m Long Nguyen Thanh Le, a passionate Computer Science student at Eastern Michigan University. With a sharp eye for design and a deep love for clean, scalable code, I bridges the gap between front-end finesse and back-end brains. Whether it's crafting responsive interfaces or optimizing database performance, I thrives on solving complex problems with elegant solutions. Fluent in Java, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, React + Node.js, etc—and never afraid to dive into Rust, Scala, or whatever the project calls for—I believes the best code is invisible: it just works. With experience in both partime job as IT Help Desk Technician and academic rigor, I brings a balance of innovation and structure to every team. I'm always excited to learn, collaborate, and turn ideas into reality. Fun fact about me, I treat Leetcode the same as Workout. No pain no gain!!! Check out my website: "
